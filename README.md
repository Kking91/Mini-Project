## Code Refactoring Project

  This project contains a website that needed to be refactored and cleaned up. The object is to make the code more accessible while keeping the original intent of the code intact.  


To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
